# About
ProjectFNF is a engine for Friday Night Funkin' designed to be flexible. It contains a few quality of life enhancements along with a whole [wiki](https://github.com/aflacc/ProjectFNF/wiki) which can help the user make their own mod. To Begin coding with ProjectFNF, follow this guide I created [Here](https://github.com/aflacc/ProjectFNF/wiki/Setup-Workspace). Interested in trying the beta?

# Mods that use ProjectFNF
- neo (woah)

# Usage
We do not ask for much, all we ask is you link the github and if the mod is on gamebanana make sure to credit "aflack" for making the engine. Also please do not remove the ProjectFNF version on the bottom of the screen in the main menu, this gives the engine its credit and also makes it easier to receive help with the mod. I will *not* be able to help you if you do not have the version of ProjectFNF in the game.
